#TV Script Generation
In this project, you'll generate your own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. You'll be using part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.

## Installation
This project requires **Python 3.6.0** and the following Python libraries installed:
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)

## Run
In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `Generate-TV-Scripts/` (that contains this README) and run the following command:

```bash
jupyter notebook dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb
```

or
```bash
jupyter notebook dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb.ipynb
```

on any Jupyter Notebook.
This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.
